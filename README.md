R Shiny Project  
Drink Finder: A Personalized Cocktail Recommender  

This Shiny app was created to help bar- and restaurant-goers choose alcoholic beverages without tasting them first. When the app is run, the data is read in from the "ProjectData.xlsx" file. The user is prompted to enter their preferences of alcohol type, sweetness level, and flavors, and recommended cocktails are outputted in two forms: an informative table and images with information about each cocktail. The images are stored in the "www" folder.
